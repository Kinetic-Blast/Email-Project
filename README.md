# Email-Project

I'm currently in the process of developing a system that aims to analyze incoming emails to identify potential phishing attempts and also conduct scans on email attachments via VirusTotal. Please keep in mind that this system is a work in progress and doesn't have any operational capabilities at the moment. The end goal is to generate comprehensive reports for users and, if successful, potentially automate the process of blocking malicious emails without human intervention. It's important to emphasize that this project is still in its developmental stages.
